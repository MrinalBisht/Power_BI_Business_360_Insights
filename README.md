# Business Insights 360 Project

## Project Overview

The **Business Insights 360 Project** is a comprehensive data visualization initiative created using Power BI. It is designed to provide stakeholders with real-time insights customized to their specific needs. The project comprises five primary views: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive, each of which emphasizes key metrics and KPIs to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Problem Statement

**AtliQ Hardware**, a global supplier of computer peripherals, initially enjoyed success but encountered significant losses in recent years. This decline can be attributed to their reliance on static Excel reports, which failed to deliver the insights necessary for informed decision-making. As a result, they sought the expertise of a data analytics team to develop a dynamic Power BI dashboard, serving as a multifunctional tool offering insights from various departments, including Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain.

## Project Objectives

- Establish a robust framework to generate and deliver actionable insights.
- Develop an interactive report that provides invaluable insights to finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive teams, using provided mockup dashboards as a reference.
- Perform a comprehensive analysis of various key data sources, including customer behavior, transaction history, product trends, and regional dynamics.

## Approach

The project was executed through the following phases:

- Project Planning
- Data Collection, Exploration, Transformation
- Data Modeling
- Dashboard Preparation
- Data Validation & Stakeholder Feedback Implementation

## Solution Unveiled

**Empowering Teams with a Dynamic Power BI Dashboard!**

Exciting news! The Power BI dashboard is now fully operational for AtliQ Hardware. Leveraging our expertise in data modeling, Power Query, DAX, data validation, and dashboard design, we successfully handled over 1.8 million records. The dashboard offers various views tailored to the specific needs of each team, enabling the Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain teams to make well-informed decisions effortlessly. Success achieved!
